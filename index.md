## Boxel

Embedded solutions for targetted applications.

We are creating an operating system based on XYZ (still deciding) ideal for low-power embedded platforms (specifically, Raspberry Pi) that makes it easy to create and maintain pre-built custom distributions for specific purposes. We are using it to build our own radio products, but you can use it to make yours for any purpose.
